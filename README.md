# Animazing

Animazing is an extension of the Colab Notebook implemented by Chervonij [1]. It implements a Deepfake Generation Model which takes a video from the user and swaps the face of the user with his/her desired character in a video clip. For our colab, we have created an Anvil web application to make the program easy to use. To run Anvil application with Google Colab, no installations are required. Only a stable internect connection and a browser is required.

The anvil app can be accessed here: https://anvil.works/build#clone:UZNAAWUAFEUHU7GT=JV74POR6A3SDRIQVZ3KLTO23

The Google Colab can be accessed here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uU6sTAx4pbcSLWxe4uyYVg0GYms6liUR?usp=sharing

1. Open the link and go to the settings of the web application.

2. Enable the server uplink and copy the uplink key.
3. Paste this key in the Anvil Key module of the Colab Notebook.
